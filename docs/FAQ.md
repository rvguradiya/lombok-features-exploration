# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ covers common questions about using the Lombok library and its features. If you have additional questions, feel free to open an issue in the repository or consult the [official Lombok documentation](https://projectlombok.org/).

## General Questions

### 1. **What is Lombok?**
Lombok is a Java library that reduces boilerplate code by generating common code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors) at compile time using annotations. It simplifies development and enhances code readability.

### 2. **Why should I use Lombok?**
Lombok saves time and effort by automating repetitive coding tasks, such as writing getter/setter methods, constructors, and builder patterns. This makes your code cleaner, more concise, and easier to maintain.

### 3. **Is Lombok stable and production-ready?**
Yes, Lombok is widely used in production environments and has been stable for many years. However, exercise caution when using experimental features as they may change in future releases.

## Installation and Setup

### 4. **How do I add Lombok to my project?**
- **Maven:** Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
      <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
      <version>1.18.28</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  ```
- **Gradle:** Add the following to your `build.gradle`:
  ```groovy
  implementation 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.28'
  annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.28'
  ```
- Enable annotation processing in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

### 5. **How do I enable Lombok in IntelliJ IDEA?**
1. Install the Lombok plugin from the IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace.
2. Enable annotation processing: `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors`, then check "Enable annotation processing."

### 6. **How do I enable Lombok in Eclipse?**
1. Download and run the Lombok JAR: `java -jar lombok.jar`.
2. Point the installer to your Eclipse installation.
3. Restart Eclipse and enable annotation processing in project properties.

## Usage

### 7. **How does Lombok work?**
Lombok uses annotation processing to generate code during compilation. The generated methods and constructors are included in the bytecode but are not visible in the source files.

### 8. **Can I customize the behavior of Lombok-generated methods?**
Yes, you can customize certain aspects of Lombok-generated methods using its annotation parameters. For example:
- Use `@Getter(lazy = true)` to generate a lazy-loaded getter.
- Use `@ToString(exclude = {"field1", "field2"})` to exclude specific fields from the `toString` method.

### 9. **What is the difference between `@Data` and `@Value`?**
- `@Data`: Generates getters, setters, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`, and a constructor. It is used for mutable classes.
- `@Value`: Generates similar methods but makes the class immutable by default (all fields are `final`).

## Debugging and Maintenance

### 10. **How can I view the code generated by Lombok?**
- Use the `javap` command to inspect the compiled bytecode:
  ```bash
  javap -c -p YourClassName
  ```
- Many IDEs have a "decompile" feature that allows you to view the generated code.

### 11. **What happens if I remove Lombok from my project?**
If Lombok is removed, all Lombok-generated methods and constructors will no longer exist in the compiled bytecode. To mitigate this, consider replacing Lombok annotations with explicit implementations before removing the library.

### 12. **How do I troubleshoot issues with Lombok?**
- Ensure that annotation processing is enabled in your IDE.
- Verify that the Lombok dependency is correctly added to your build file (Maven or Gradle).
- Update the Lombok version to the latest stable release.

## Advanced Topics

### 13. **What are Lombok`s experimental features?**
Lombok provides some experimental features, such as:
- `@SuperBuilder`: A builder for classes with inheritance.
- `@With`: Generates a method for creating a copy of an object with a modified field.

Use these features with caution, as they may not be fully stable.

### 14. **Can I exclude Lombok from certain classes?**
Yes, you can prevent Lombok from processing specific classes by using the `@NoArgsConstructor(force = false)` or other exclusions. Additionally, you can configure exclusions in the `lombok.config` file.

### 15. **Is Lombok compatible with other frameworks?**
Yes, Lombok works well with most frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate). However, ensure that the generated code aligns with the requirements of the framework. For example:
- Use `@NoArgsConstructor` for JPA entities.
- Customize `@EqualsAndHashCode` to avoid issues with Hibernate proxies.

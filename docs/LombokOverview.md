# Lombok Overview

Lombok is a Java library designed to simplify coding by reducing boilerplate code. It uses annotations to automatically generate commonly used code, such as getters, setters, constructors, and more, directly during the compilation process. By integrating Lombok, developers can focus more on the business logic of their applications while maintaining cleaner, more readable code.

## Key Features

### 1. Simplified Getters and Setters
- With Lombok, you can eliminate the need to manually write getter and setter methods.
- Annotation: `@Getter`, `@Setter`

Example:
```java
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

### 2. Constructor Generation
- Lombok can generate constructors for your classes with a single annotation.
- Annotations: `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`

Example:
```java
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String role;
}
```

### 3. Builder Pattern
- The `@Builder` annotation generates a builder for your class, making object creation intuitive and flexible.

Example:
```java
import lombok.Builder;

@Builder
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;
}

// Usage:
Product product = Product.builder()
                         .name("Laptop")
                         .price(999.99)
                         .build();
```

### 4. Data Classes
- The `@Data` annotation combines multiple features (e.g., `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`) into a single annotation.

Example:
```java
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class Customer {
    private String id;
    private String email;
}
```

### 5. Logging Support
- Lombok provides logging annotations for various logging frameworks (e.g., SLF4J, Log4j, etc.).
- Annotation: `@Slf4j`

Example:
```java
import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;

@Slf4j
public class LoggerExample {
    public void logMessage() {
        log.info("Logging with Lombok!");
    }
}
```

### 6. Exception Handling
- The `@SneakyThrows` annotation allows methods to throw checked exceptions without declaring them in the method signature.

Example:
```java
import lombok.SneakyThrows;

public class FileReaderExample {
    @SneakyThrows
    public void readFile(String fileName) {
        java.nio.file.Files.readAllLines(java.nio.file.Paths.get(fileName));
    }
}
```

### 7. Utility Classes
- The `@UtilityClass` annotation simplifies the creation of utility classes by marking the class as final and its constructor as private, while making all methods static.

Example:
```java
import lombok.experimental.UtilityClass;

@UtilityClass
public class MathUtils {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Using Lombok

- **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Write less repetitive code, such as getters, setters, and constructors.
- **Improved Readability**: Cleaner and more concise code enhances maintainability.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with most build tools (Maven, Gradle) and IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- **Customizable**: Use the `lombok.config` file to tailor Lombok's behavior to your project.

---

## Limitations

1. **IDE Dependency**: Some IDEs require configuration to recognize Lombok annotations.
2. **Compile-Time Dependency**: Lombok annotations are processed during compilation, meaning the library must be present in your build environment.
3. **Learning Curve**: Understanding all features and their implications may take time for new users.

## How to Add Lombok to Your Project

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.28</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```groovy
implementation 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.28'
annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.28'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Sparingly**: Avoid overusing Lombok to maintain code readability, especially with complex features.
2. **Document Lombok Usage**: Clearly document which annotations are being used and why.
3. **Educate Team Members**: Ensure all team members are familiar with Lombok and its impact on the codebase.
4. **Monitor Updates**: Stay updated with new Lombok versions and features to avoid compatibility issues.
